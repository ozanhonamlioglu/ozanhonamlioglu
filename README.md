## ABOUT ME
Hi there, I am a full stack mobile developer who mainly works with React Native and .NET technologies.   
I have been in the bussiness almost more than 8 years and even now I am a React Native developer but in the past I was an Objective-c and Swift programmer on Apple platforms. Also at the backend I have been developing with PHP at 2011, then used to be a Python Django developer and a Node js developer since I am a JavaScript developer. So clearly I can say that since I started to programming, my main focus is in backend and mobile platforms.

## SPECIALTY
Mobile (React Native), Backend(.NET) and Compilers(Currently working with "Babel JavaScript" compiler but I have well knowledge on overall compilers and interpreters).
